\chapter{Microstrip silicon detectors for space applications}
\label{cap:gamma400}

In space applications the power consumption is a major issue. Power saving can
be achieved for example reducing as much as possible the number of readout
channel. On the other side reducing the number of readout channels the spatial
resolution is decreased as well.\\
In this part of my research activity I characterised and compared different
readout approaches with respect different layout of the silicon microstrip
sensor. The final goal is to determine the optimal compromise between number of
channels and spatial resolution.
